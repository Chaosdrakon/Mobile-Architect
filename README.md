# Mobile-Architect
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The requirement for this application was to development an app that an inventory company could use. There was a need for the applciation to flow smoothly and have the ability to login. This application needed to ahve the ability to add and remove items throughout a database along with the ability to update and change the counts on already established inventory.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The first thing that needed to be implimented was a login screen in order to protect the clients inventory and the data that was being held within the app. The next thing to work on was gridding out the inventory when it was on the so it was easy to understand what was happening at a glance but also contained a lot of information about each item. The last thing that need to be added was the ability to add, remove, and edit an item that was in the inventory system to ensure everything was to up today.
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?7
  I worked on one screen at a time until i was satisfied with how the screen worked. Then I would create the next screen and before I even started adding features to that screen I would ensure that i could get to it from the first screen to ensure that app was working properly. THan after the screens were linked than i would start adding features to the nesscary screens to ensure everything still worked and function as it was intended
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  Everytime I added a function or changed a theme or layout i would rerun the app to ensure that not only that the app would start correctly but also behaving the way that i wanted it to behave. Some testing was done instantly after a change such as when i added a feautre but when i changed theme colors i wanted until everything was changed than tested the app.
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  Getting the inventory system to correctly update with itself when it went from once screen to the next was very important and was a but of a struggle. I ended up not only using the save information and than hiding that value in the background to ensure that it would translate onto a previous screen.
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  The theme creation is where i feel like i thrived the most and got to have the most fun. have the ability to change icons and colors and how everything flowed probably the most successful part of the development process but finishing it and making working apps through out the entire course was mre rewarding and allowed me to gain greater knowledge.
